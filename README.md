## TemperatureTube

TemperatureTube is a real time temperature simulator for the tube, when the liquid flow moves in it. 

Can be used to visualize the temperature of the outer surface of the tube in models of industrial rooms, machines and units, laboratory equipment. The length, diameter and wall thickness of the tube may vary.

Flow rate g(τ), flow temperature at the inlet to the tube t (τ) and ambient temperature a(τ) independently change over time according to dependence:

f (τ) = a + b × Sin (c × τ).

Such the dependence is universal, it can establish constant and variables values of parameters with a wide or narrow range of variation.

Now the tube is made from Steel, and Water flows inside it. Other materials that can be used to make the pipe (for example, Plastic,...), as well as other substances that flow in the pipe (for example, Air,...) can be added.


The Unity version of the simulator is available [here](). It focuses on the representation of the temperature field of the tube in the form of a color gradient.
